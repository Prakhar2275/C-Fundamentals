# C Language Basics and Projects 📘💻

Hey! I'm Prakhar, and this repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C language projects and programs. These were created while I was learning C and exploring how the language can be used to build simple but practical applications.

If you're just starting with C programming, these examples are a great way to understand the fundamentals and how to apply them in real-world-style mini-projects.

## 📂 Projects Included

- **Hourglass Pattern**: A pattern-printing program using nested loops.
- **Library Management System**: A basic system to manage books and users using file handling in C.
- **Mini Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- **Tic Tac Toe Game**: Console-based two-player game logic.
- **Calendar Sample**: A basic program demonstrating date and loop logic.
- **Simple Calculator (calculator.c)**: Another version of a basic calculator.
- **Correction Work**: Miscellaneous fixes or learning experiments.
- **Library Data File (library.dat)**: Binary file used in the Library Management System.

## ⚙️ Concepts Covered

- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- File handling (`.dat` files)
- Arrays and matrices
- User input/output
- Modular programming and logic building

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

This repo is meant to help others (and myself) understand core C programming concepts through hands-on practice. 
I’ve documented these to track my progress and to help others get started with small but useful C projects.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (like GCC).
2. Compile the `.c` files using a terminal or code editor.
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputname
   ./outputname
